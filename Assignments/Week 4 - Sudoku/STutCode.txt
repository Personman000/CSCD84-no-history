%
%  We will practice solving a CSP using backtracking 
%  search. The basic search process will be implemented
%  recursively, and the function will keep track of how
%  many times it's called until a solution is found.
%
%  We will then implement the various variable selection
%  strategies discussed in lecture, and check how much 
%  of a reduction in search we get from those.
%
%  The task at hand is sudoku. The input is a partially
%  completed sudoku puzzle (which is just a 9x9 array
%  with numbers 1-9. Unassigned squares are marked with 0)
%
%  Your task is to implement backtracking search, then
%  to enhance it to implement variable selection 
%  methods as discussed in lecture.
%
%  [sol]=SuDoKu(input)
%  
%  input - a 9x9 array containing the initial puzzle
%  sol - a 9x9 array with the completed puzzle

    % that DO NOT BREAK any constraints.

    %% TO DO:
    %% Modify the solver provided to implement the variable ordering criteria
    %% we discussed in lecture:
    %% 1 - Choose first the variable with fewest remaining values
    %% 2 - If (1) has a tie, choose variable that intervenes in more active constraints
    %% 3 - Once you have chosen a variable, select the least constraining value to try first!
    %%
    %% You have to decide how to keep track of 
    %%   # of valid values left for each unassigned cell
    %%   # of active constraints for each unassigned cell
    %%
    %% And you need to think about how to check which values are least constraining.
    %% since there may be many, you'll need to sort them from least constraining to
    %% most constraining!
    %%
    %% BUT! the goal is not to make the most efficient data structure for these things!
    %% (that's not what Matlab's for, you can do that in C if you like). Here, we only
    %% care about *reduction in the number of calls to SuDoKu()* which tells us something
    %% important about the size of the search tree! 
    %%
    %% It is assumed you can then make your data structures fast in a language designed
    %% to do so, and the improved algorithm (which uses the variable selection process
    %% we just described) will beat the 'vanilla' version because of the reduction in
    %% the number of nodes that need to be expanded to reach the full solution.
    %%
    %% So - don't spend time writing clever data structures, just get this to work, and
    %% see what you can tell about how much it saves in terms of calls to SuDoKu().
